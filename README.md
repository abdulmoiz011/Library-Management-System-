# Console-based Library Management System with SQLite Database

This project implements a console-based Library Management System (LMS) using Java programming language and SQLite database. The system provides functionalities for managing library resources including books, users, and borrowing records, all accessible through a user-friendly console interface.

## Features

- **User Management:**
  - Add, remove, and update user information.
  - Search for books, borrow, and return them.

  - Add, remove, and update book details including title, author, genre, and availability status.
  - Search for books by title, author, or genre.

- **Borrowing Management:**
  - Implement borrowing functionality with check-out and return options.
  - Maintain borrowing history and due dates for each borrowed book.

- **Database Integration:**
  - Utilize SQLite database for efficient storage and management of library data.
  - Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books, users, and borrowing records.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Authenticate users to ensure secure access to the system.
  - Define roles (librarian, user) with appropriate permissions.
